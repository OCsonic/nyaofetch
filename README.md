# Nyaofetch
## What is this?
Nyaofetch is a tool meant to replace and expand on as much Neofetch functionality as possible while maintaining faster speeds all while still using of bash.

Currently I advice against using it because it's undergoing some major refactoring to improve functionality and speed.

## Installation
This program requires [boltauthd](https://codeberg.org/BasilBasil/boltauthd) to be installed in order for GPU detection to work properly.

After boltauthd is installed then you just need to put [nyaofetch](./nyaofetch) into /usr/bin/

After that you just put the contents of [nyaofetch-etc](./nyaofetch-etc) into /etc/nyaofetch/
